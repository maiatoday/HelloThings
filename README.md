# HelloThings
Android Things and Firebase experiment.

Rasberry Pi with AndroidThings and two leds, a green one on BCM26 and a red on on BCM16. The Pi gets updates from Firebase to indicate if the leds are on or off. 

Companion app which shows the states of the two leds in the app. Also if you touch the leds in the app it toggles the state on Firebase and also on the Pi.
